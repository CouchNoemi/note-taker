# Note-taker

## description
My motivation to do this project is learning more about Express.js, experiment with different methods and improve my skills. I built this project to create a note taker so  this can be used to create an easy memo so I can remember importan meetings at work. I challenged my imagination and compared the different uses of my code.
This app lets you create notes, save it and delete it. it has a good interaction with the user.
My project is a backend that created a front end website, tested with insomnia and deployed with Heroku

 ## Usage
 - To use the back end app download all the files
 - For this application I used the express package.
-  Before starting to use the application make sure the packages are installed on the app use (nmp i).
-open the website to try the front end application
-Its gonna let you save, start a new note and delete a note.
