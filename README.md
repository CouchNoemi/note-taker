# Logo-maker

## description
My motivation to do this project is learning more about OOP, experiment with different methods and improve my skills. I built this project to create a logo maker so  this can be used to create a easy logo maker so I do not have to hire more personel. I challenged my imagination and compared the different uses of my code.
I made different questions to make the user pick text, textColor, shape and, shapeColor. it has a good interaction with the user.
My project is a backend that creater a front end website with my logo displayed on the screen.

 ## Usage

-  After that go to the index.js file and open the terminal with the (node index.js) to start the questionary.
- A SVG file gets created which contains the logo.
- Open the logo with live server.
